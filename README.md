# Lever Source

This package models Lever data from [Fivetran's Opportunity endpoint connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/lever). It uses data in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/lever#schemainformation).
> NOTE: If your Lever connector was created [prior to July 2020](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/lever/changelog) or still uses the Candidate endpoint, you must fully re-sync your connector or set up a new connector to use Fivetran's Lever dbt packages.

This package helps you understand trends in recruiting, interviewing, and hiring at your company. It also provides recruiting stakeholders with information about individual opportunities, interviews, and jobs. It achieves this by:
- Enriching the core opportunity, interview, job posting, and requisition tables with relevant pipeline data and metrics
- Integrating the interview table with reviewer information and feedback
- Calculating the velocity of opportunities through each pipeline stage, alongside major job- and candidate-related attributes for segmented funnel analysis

## Models
This package contains staging models, designed to work simultaneously with our [Lever modeling package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_lever).  The staging models:
* Remove any rows that are soft-deleted
* Name columns consistently across all packages:
    * Boolean fields are prefixed with `is_` or `has_`
    * Timestamps are appended with `_at`
    * ID primary keys are prefixed with the name of the table.  For example, a user table's ID column is renamed `user_id`.
    * Foreign keys include the table that they refer to. For example, a interview's interview user ID column is renamed `interviewer_user_id`.

## Installation Instructions
Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions, or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.

## Configuration
By default, this package looks for your Lever data in the `lever` schema of your [target database](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/running-a-dbt-project/using-the-command-line-interface/configure-your-profile). If this is not where your Lever data is, add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
    lever_database: your_database_name
    lever_schema: your_schema_name 
```

### Disabling Models
Your Lever connector might not sync every table that this package expects. If your syncs exclude certain tables, it is because you either don't use that functionality in Lever or have actively excluded some tables from your syncs. To disable the corresponding functionality in the package, you must add the relevant variables. By default, all variables are assumed to be `true`. Add variables for only the tables you would like to disable:  

```yml
# dbt_project.yml
...
config-version: 2

vars:
    lever_using_requisitions: false # Disable if you do not have the requisition table, or if you do not want requisition related metrics reported
```

### Passing Through Custom Columns
If you choose to include requisitions, the `REQUISITION` table may also have custom columns (all prefixed by `custom_field_`). To pass these columns through to the [final requisition model](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_lever/blob/master/models/lever__requisition_enhanced.sql), add the following variable to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
    lever_requisition_passthrough_columns: ['the', 'list', 'of', 'fields']
```
